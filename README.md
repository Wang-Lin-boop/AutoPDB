AutoFishTargetï¼šAutomatic acquisition and processing of protein structure, and identification of small molecular ligands by reverse docking.

FUPC.sh is a shell script to generate PDB-Chain File From Uniprot xml files, give an uniprot.xml file(can be downloaded in uniprot by search protein your interested or mapping some enrty ID) and a Entry_list.txt, this scipet will tell you the number of enrtys in you job and how many entry without pdb structure, and generate PDB chain file for your next step research.

The project is still in its inital stage, Feel free to help with suggestions and contibutions.
